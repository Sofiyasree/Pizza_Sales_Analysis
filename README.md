# Statistics Project – Pizza Sales Data

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on applying basic statistical concepts using the Pizza Sales dataset.
The analysis is done using Python to understand sales patterns and data behavior.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand population and sampling
- Apply different sampling techniques
- Demonstrate Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Analyze normal distribution
- Identify outliers using Z-Score
- Derive simple business insights



## 📁 Dataset
- Pizza Sales Dataset


## 🧩 Analysis Performed

### Population & Sampling
- Treated the full dataset as population
- Created a random sample from the data

### Sampling Techniques
- Random sampling
- Systematic sampling
- Compared population mean with sample means

### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Took multiple samples of size 30
- Calculated sample means
- Observed normal distribution of sample means

### Normal Distribution
- Calculated mean and standard deviation
- Plotted histogram
- Applied 68–95–99.7 rule

### Z-Score & Outliers
- Calculated Z-Score for total price
- Identified unusual high-value orders as outliers

### Business Insights
- Explained importance of sampling
- Role of CLT in analytics
- Importance of normal distribution
- Use of Z-Score in finding unusual values


## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy


## 📂 Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Word Report (.docx)
- Output plots
